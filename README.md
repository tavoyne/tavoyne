# Hi there, I'm Theophile Avoyne ðŸ‘‹

I think many of us engineers are stuck in companies that aren't exciting enough, working on code that isn't challenging enough, and are underpaid compared to what we could earn in the market.

We're not prospecting because the job-seeking process is such a pain, and it would be awkward if our boss heard about it.

I created [Candix.com](https://candix.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=GitHub) to solve that.

It's the first confidential and intermediary-free hiring marketplace.

It connects you with the most exciting and top-paying startups in the US and abroad, all while maintaining the highest level of confidentiality for your data.

Usage is skyrocketing, with companies like OpenAI, Ramp, and many others accessing the pool.

Curious? [Sign up in 2 minutes](https://candix.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=GitHub) and change your life for the better.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto=theophile@candix.com) if you want to learn more.
