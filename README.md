# 🔥 What would it take for you to quit your job?

Many of us engineers are underpaid compared to what we could earn in the market. We don't realize it because we're not actively seeking new opportunities, and the only contact we have with the job market is recruiters harassing us with bad offers.

To solve that, we built [Candix.com](https://candix.com/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=GitHub), the first confidential and intermediary-free hiring marketplace.

## How it works:
1. You create a profile, specifying what you look for in a job.
2. We connect you with selected startups in our network.
3. Startups reach out to you with personalized job opportunities.

## Why it's so cool:
- It connects you with the top 1% of tech startups. ✨
- Companies are charged, not you. 🎁
- It's confidential, meaning your current employer won't find out. 🔒
- No agencies. Hell no, Satan. 🙅‍♂️

Usage is skyrocketing, with companies like OpenAI, Ramp, and dozens of others accessing the pool.
